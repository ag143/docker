docker desktop:
Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac or Windows environment that enables you to build and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, Docker Content Trust, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper.

# docker engine(daemon)
Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with:

A server with a long-running daemon process dockerd.
APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
A command line interface (CLI) client docker.

#docker compose
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. 

docker hub
Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team. It is the world’s largest repository of container images with an array of content sources including container community developers, open source projects and independent software vendors (ISV) building and distributing their code in containers.

docker subscription
On August 31, 2021, we announced updates and extensions to our product subscriptions to increase productivity, collaboration, and added security for our developers and businesses. Docker subscription tiers now include Personal, Pro, Team, and Business.

Administration
An Organization is a collection of teams and repositories that can be managed together. Docker users become members of an organization when they are assigned to at least one team in the organization. When you first create an organization, you’ll see that you have a team, the owners (Admins) team, with a single member. An organization owner is someone that is part of the owners team.

Registry
The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images. The Registry is open-source, under the permissive Apache license.
